# Chore-Champions-In-Memory-Database
### What is this?

 ### Why make this project?
This project was used to test my knowledge of databases, temporary in-memory ones in this case. It also tested my ability to connect front end to back end, utilising the java GUI tools to create interactions between users and the database I learned a lot about full stack development and databases as well as JBDI functionality. It also made me aware of what H2 and SpringBoot are and how they are used. 

My knowledge of build tools was almost specifically gradle so I decided to branch out and use something different just to see what I was missing and learn something new, hence the use of Maven.
