# Chore-Champions-In-Memory-Database
This project was used to test my knowledge of databases, temporary in-memory ones in this case. Using the old java swing libraries to create a basic UI I think used a selection of JBDI functionality to create and temporarily host a database using H2 and SpringBoot from which I could push and pull information. 
My knowledge of build tools was almost specifically gradle so I decided to branch out and use something different just to see what I was missing and learn something new, hence the use of Maven.
This is not meant to be used in any serious way and information would obviously not be well secured in this application.
